/**
 * IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT CSS ANIMATION PROPERTIES (keanulee):
 *
 * iOS Safari (tested on iOS 8.1) does not handle animation-delay very well - it doesn't
 * guarantee that the animation will start _exactly_ after that value. So we avoid using
 * animation-delay and instead set custom keyframes for each color (as redundant as it
 * seems).
 *
 * We write out each animation in full (instead of separating animation-name,
 * animation-duration, etc.) because under the polyfill, Safari does not recognize those
 * specific properties properly, treats them as -webkit-animation, and overrides the
 * other animation rules. See https://github.com/Polymer/platform/issues/53.
